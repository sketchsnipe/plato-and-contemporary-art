    B. Summary of paper/Arguments
        - However, before this you must first have a basic understanding of
            * The platonic framework
                - Metaphisics
                - Ethics
                - and Asthetics
            * Concept Art
            * and the art historic context of both and how they are related
    C. Metaphliosophy of anlysis in this paper
        - The method of interpritation          *might delete this

II. Body
    A. Foundation of Plato

        1. Metaphisics
            - Platonic Idealisim
                * There's a perfect form of an object that exists out there, and real life is merely an immitation of this. (Republic VI - VII)
                    -
        2. Ethics
            - Virtue Ethics
                * The goal of ethics is eudomonia, and the way we reach it is through having a proper hiarchy of the soul, with rationality and pursuit of ideas as the highest virtue, and desires being gone completely.
            - The City
                * Analogy for the soul
                * Definition of Good: all things functioning as the should within the city
            - The Dialectic (Book VII of the Republic)
                * Plato argues that in the higher classes of the society, the philosophical dialectic should be taught.
                * The philosophical dialectic is one of hyphothsys, questioning, and refutation where, through incrimental steps, one gets closer and closer too the truth.
                * He goes on too describe it as the highest form of knowlage, and the most noble and virtuous pursuit one can undertake.

        3. Asthetics (Book X of the Republic)
            - Immitation and MimÃªsis
                 * Syllogisim:
                    - Poetic and artistic immitation of apperance is a shallow imcomplete picture of the truth, as it can only capture surface-level observations of an object, with no actual substance (457 - 465)
                    - Therefor this immitation corrupts the perfect rational soul with impulsive nothingness, leading viewers further away from truth
                    - Thus it should be banned from the city (and by extenton, our soul).
            - Plato sees a hiarchy of truth:
                I. Form, the objective ideal
                II. Objects, material things created by humans, this is trying to emulate the ideal
                III. Art, a pale capturing of the material apperance of objects, this is trying too immitate the material
                - Thus, too plato, art is merely an "immitation of an immitation", which he sees as the ultamate form of sophristy and ignorance
            - "If poetry can come out of ignorance, it must not be based in any for of knowlage"

    B. Foundation in concept art (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conceptual-art/)
        - "Concept art is the logical conclusion of art as expressing meaning through objects, it is the dissolving of the medium, too capture beauty and wonder in its purest form, outside the bounds of any medium.
        1. Quick History of the Western Cannon of art
            - Origns
                1.. Art as immitation **Anchent art, like forever ago - 400 AD**
                2.. Art as creating beutifual, meaningful objects **Movements from Midieval 500 - Neoclassical 1850**
                3.. Art as a visual diolouge too discover beauty and meaning **Romanticism (1780) - Minimalizim (1970)
                3.. Art as a pure diolouge too discover beauty and meaning **Concept Art (1960) - Contemporary Art (Present)**
        2. Phliosophy of concept art
            - If the goal of traditional modern art is too create a beutifual object with meaning, then the goal of concept art is the logical conclustion of that line of thinking, the art was the concept/meaning itself, rather than the object.

    C. Plato applied too Concept art
        1. Concept art as a rejection of immitation and an artistic return too the ideal
        2. Concept art as a tool for dialectic
            - The individual dialectic
                * A tool for the individual logos too come too a better understanding of the world through. (https://repository.cardiffmet.ac.uk/handle/10369/8076)
            - As a modern methiod of a Socrates' "Gadfly" (as explored in the Apology diolouge) method of undermining the norms of a society too spur on greater societal dialectic. This promotes greater logos amongst the populace.
                * Known as Institutional critique
             * This means that it is not only a virtuous tool for questioning , but In fact a tool in the grand philosophical dialectic.

III. Conclusion
    A. Intro
        - Restate thesis as conclusion
    B. Evedence
        - because 1 and 2 in 2.C.
    C. End
        - Scope
            * This has implications for modern platonist scolars, and neoplatonists
