# A Middle Period Platonic Analysis of the Concept Art movement

##### by Christofer Enoch Whitehead

# Intro

In this paper I will show that, while Plato was a heavy critic of art, none of his criticisims of anchient art would apply too the modern conceptual art movement, therefor demonstrating that, from a platonic standpoint, it has more moral validity.

Before I contintue onto the main assertions of this paper, I must first establish the idological lens through which I will be reading plato;

In the modern study of plato, there are three mainstream views on how too interprete his works, the unitarian approach, which sees each of plato's dialogues as peices of the larger mosaic of his work over his career, the developmentalist approach, which divides the dialogues into three sections that genarally describe the intilectual development of plato over time. [1]

* The Early ‘Socratic’ period - with such works as the Apology, Crito, Euthyphro, Charmides, Ion, Lysis, Laches, Hippias Minor, Menexenus, Euthydemus, Protagoras, and Hippias Major.
* The Middle peroid - with Cratylus, Symposium, Phaedo, and the Republic
* The Late "post-Republic" period with the works Parmenides, Theaetetus, Sophist, Politicus, Timaeus, Philebus and Laws, and the Critias.

This interpritation would have you describe which section of plato you would be reffrenceing, as he expresses diffrent opinions in diffrent periods.
The final more nuanced view of plato's works, and the one that I personally agree with most (and will subsaquently be using for this paper), is the revisionist interpritation. This interpritation sees each of plato's dialogues as existing as an island too themselves, and therefor, any inconsistancy between the idology expressed in the dialogue, can be explaned very simply as a revision on plato's part.

The consaquense of this view that each dialogue being a minor revision, is that I will only be able too analyze the opinions expressed in a single one of his books, without being able too fall back on his numerous (but admittidly self-contradictory) library of litturature on this subject.

In this paper, I will only be using the views expressed in The Republic, as that is where a majority of his crituques of art come from.
